# Bitcoin Price Prediction

This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using machine learning techniques and provides a web-based interface for visualization and interaction.

## üìÅ Project Structure

* **Yet\_another\_copy\_of\_Bitcoin\_Price\_Prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.
* **index.html**: Main webpage serving as the entry point for the web application.
* **predict.html**: Webpage dedicated to displaying prediction results.
* **graph.html**: Webpage for visualizing Bitcoin price trends.
* **grpjs.js**: JavaScript file handling dynamic functionalities for graph rendering.
* **indexjs.js**: JavaScript file managing interactions on the main page.
* **grp.css**: CSS file styling the graph visualization components.
* **style.css**: CSS file for general styling across the web pages.
* **background.jpg**: Background image used in the web application.
* **grpBack.svg**: SVG graphic used in the graph visualization.

## üß† Model Overview

The machine learning model is developed using Python and trained on historical Bitcoin price data. The notebook includes:

* Data collection and preprocessing steps.
* Model architecture and training process.
* Evaluation metrics and results.

*Note: Specific details about the model architecture and data sources are provided within the Jupyter Notebook.*

## üåê Web Application

The web interface allows users to:

* View historical Bitcoin price trends.
* Input data to receive price predictions.
* Interact with dynamic graphs and visualizations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Web browser (for viewing HTML pages)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Future7dev/Bitcoin-Price-prediction-.git
   cd Bitcoin-Price-prediction-
   ```

2. **Install required Python packages:**

   *(Ensure you have a virtual environment set up)*

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: The `requirements.txt` file should list all necessary Python packages.*

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open `Yet_another_copy_of_Bitcoin_Price_Prediction.ipynb` and execute the cells to train and evaluate the model.

4. **Launch the web application:**

   Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to interact with the application.

## üìä Visualization

The application provides interactive graphs to visualize:

* Historical Bitcoin prices.
* Predicted price trends based on the trained model.
